# Morse Code Decoder (Arduino Project)

## Overview
This Arduino project allows users to input Morse code using two buttons (dot and dash) and decode it into text. The decoded message is displayed on an OLED screen.

The project is built using an **Arduino** board, **OLED display**, and simple button inputs. It uses the **Wire** and **U8g2lib** libraries for communication with the OLED.

## Features
- Encode Morse code by pressing two buttons: one for dots (.) and one for dashes (-).
- Decodes the input Morse code into text (letters A-Z and numbers 0-9).
- Displays the Morse code and decoded message on an OLED screen.
- A timeout feature detects when a letter is completed and starts decoding.

## Components Required
- Arduino Board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- OLED Display (128x64, I2C)
- 2 Push Buttons (one for dot, one for dash)
- Breadboard and wires

## Wiring Diagram
1. **Dot Button** connected to pin 6 on Arduino.
2. **Dash Button** connected to pin 9 on Arduino.
3. **OLED Display (I2C)** connected to **SCL** and **SDA** pins on Arduino.

## Libraries Used
- **Wire**: For I2C communication with the OLED display.
- **U8g2lib**: For controlling the OLED display.

## Code Explanation
1. The **dotButtonPin** and **dashButtonPin** read the states of the buttons (for dots and dashes).
2. Morse code is generated by pressing the buttons, with dots (.) and dashes (-) being stored in a string.
3. The **decodeMorse** function decodes the Morse code into text based on a predefined Morse code table.
4. The decoded message is displayed on the OLED screen, and after a timeout, the code resets for the next letter.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/u0sf/Morse-Code-Decoder.git
